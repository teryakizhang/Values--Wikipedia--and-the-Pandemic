# Values Wikipedia and the Pandemic

This project uses exploratory data analysis techniques to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between big social data and data on the COVID-19 pandemic. 

There are two parts to the project:
* Part 1 looks at relationships between cultural values and attempts to identify patterns of interest with pandemic performance. Cultural values data are drawn from the World Value Survey (WVS).
* Part 2 examined the relationship between health information quality and epedemiology outcomes. Using Wikipedia articles as a proxy of health information available on a country, the data is linked with epedimelogy data in a number of ways.
